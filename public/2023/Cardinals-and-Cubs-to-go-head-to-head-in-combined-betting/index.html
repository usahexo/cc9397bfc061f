        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      		<h1 id="Cardinals-and-Cubs-to-go-head-to-head-in-combined-betting"><a href="#Cardinals-and-Cubs-to-go-head-to-head-in-combined-betting" class="headerlink" title="Cardinals and Cubs to go head-to-head in combined betting"></a>Cardinals and Cubs to go head-to-head in combined betting</h1><p>The St. Louis Cardinals and the Chicago Cubs are set to play each other in a combined betting matchup. The Cardinals hold at +115 odds, while the Cubs are at -135. </p>
<p>This game is important for both teams as they chase down division leaders Milwaukee and Pittsburgh, respectively. The Cardinals have had an up-and-down season, but remain in the hunt for a playoff berth. The Cubs have been one of the most surprising teams in baseball, thanks to their young talent playing up to expectations.</p>
<p>Led by MVP candidate Kris Bryant and Cy Young candidate Jake Arrieta, the Cubs are a strong team that is expected to make a deep run into the playoffs this year. However, the Cardinals have a few players who can hurt them as well.</p>
<p>Players to watch in this matchup include Matt Carpenter for the Cardinals and Anthony Rizzo for the Cubs. Carpenter is having an MVP-caliber season, while Rizzo is one of the most consistent hitters in baseball. If these two players can get going, it could be a long day for the opposing team’s pitching staff. </p>
<p>Overall, this should be an exciting game to watch, with both teams battling it out until the very end. Who will come out on top? Only time will tell.</p>
<h1 id="Cardinals-and-Dodgers-set-for-intense-rivalry-in-combined-betting"><a href="#Cardinals-and-Dodgers-set-for-intense-rivalry-in-combined-betting" class="headerlink" title="Cardinals and Dodgers set for intense rivalry in combined betting"></a>Cardinals and Dodgers set for intense rivalry in combined betting</h1><p>The National League West looks poised to be one of the most exciting divisions in baseball this season, with the Los Angeles Dodgers and St. Louis Cardinals set to battle it out for supremacy.</p>
<p>Both teams are stacked with star talent, making them attractive picks for those looking to place a combined bet.</p>
<p>The Dodgers are led by ace Clayton Kershaw, who is coming off another Cy Young-winning season. He’ll be supported by a lineup that features sluggers like Corey Seager and Cody Bellinger.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Cardinals have perennial MVP candidate Paul Goldschmidt batting cleanup, as well as young stars like Jack Flaherty and Miles Mikolas in their rotation.</p>
<p>This should be an intense rivalry, with both teams fighting for the division crown until the very end.</p>
<h1 id="Cardinals-look-to-close-the-gap-on-Dodgers-in-combined-betting"><a href="#Cardinals-look-to-close-the-gap-on-Dodgers-in-combined-betting" class="headerlink" title="Cardinals look to close the gap on Dodgers in combined betting"></a>Cardinals look to close the gap on Dodgers in combined betting</h1><p>The St. Louis Cardinals (68-64, third in the NL Central) and Los Angeles Dodgers (77-57, first in the NL West) have had very different seasons, but that is reflected in the betting odds as well. The Dodgers are currently -240 favorites to win the division, while the Cardinals are +650 underdogs. However, at this point in the season there is only a six-game difference between the two teams, so if you believe that L.A.’s hot streak is unsustainable and St. Louis can close the gap, there is value to be found in taking them to win the division.</p>
<p>The Cardinals have been up-and-down all season long, but they seem to be heating up at just the right time. Over their last 10 games they are 7-3 and have outscored their opponents by a total of 26 runs. Rookie sensation Alex Reyes has been a huge part of that resurgence; he has pitched brilliantly since rejoining the team on August 15th and currently has an ERA of 1.47 over his last five starts. If he can continue to pitch like that down the stretch, it will go a long way towards helping St. Louis make a run at the division title.</p>
<p>As for the Dodgers, they come into this series on a nine-game winning streak and show no signs of slowing down. However, eight of those nine wins were against teams with losing records, so it will be interesting to see how they fare against tougher competition. For what it’s worth, Los Angeles is only 3-5 against teams with winning records over their last eight games.</p>
<p>One thing that could give St. Louis a boost in this series is home field advantage; they are 43-27 at home this season while L.A. is only 31-35 on the road. The first game of this series will be played at Busch Stadium on Thursday night, so make sure to tune in and see if the Cardinals can pull off an upset!</p>
<h1 id="Cardinals-and-Giants-to-battle-it-out-in-combined-betting"><a href="#Cardinals-and-Giants-to-battle-it-out-in-combined-betting" class="headerlink" title="Cardinals and Giants to battle it out in combined betting"></a>Cardinals and Giants to battle it out in combined betting</h1><p>The MLB betting scene is heating up as the playoffs are set to begin next week. There are a few matchups that have oddsmakers divided, but one of the most interesting ones is the duel between the St. Louis Cardinals and San Francisco Giants.</p>
<p>Both teams have been playing well as of late, with the Cardinals winning their last six games and the Giants taking five of their last six. However, if you look at the betting odds, you will see that the Cardinals are favored by around -140 on most sportsbooks.</p>
<p>This may seem like a big spread for a matchup between two evenly matched teams, but there is good reason for it. The Cardinals have been one of the best teams in baseball all season long, while the Giants have been streaky and inconsistent.</p>
<p>With that said, there is still value to be had on San Francisco in this matchup. The Giants may not be as good as St. Louis overall, but they are more than capable of pulling off an upset win in this series.</p>
<p>If you are looking to bet on this matchup, I would recommend picking San Francisco to win at least one game. They could definitely lose 3-0 or even 3-1, but I think they have a good chance of winning at least once in this series.</p>
<h1 id="Cardinals-set-to-dominate-National-League-in-combined-betting"><a href="#Cardinals-set-to-dominate-National-League-in-combined-betting" class="headerlink" title="Cardinals set to dominate National League in combined betting"></a>Cardinals set to dominate National League in combined betting</h1><p>As the National League baseball season gets set to begin, many fans and bettors alike are looking at the St. Louis Cardinals as a lock to take the division. The Cardinals have made some significant moves in the offseason, and it looks like they will be even better this year.</p>
<p>They have added Marcell Ozuna to their lineup, who is coming off a great season with the Miami Marlins. He provides some much-needed power to their lineup and gives them a middle of the order threat. Their starting rotation is also very strong, led by ace pitcher Carlos Martinez.</p>
<p>There are some concerns about their bullpen, but they should still be one of the top teams in the National League this season. In terms of betting, they are currently listed as -170 favorites to win the division, which means that they are expected to win it more than two-thirds of the time.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are currently the second favorites in Las Vegas to win the National League, but they are a significantly distant second at +450. The next team in line is the Chicago Cubs, who are +650 at most sportsbooks.</p>
<p>It is clear that most people expect the Cardinals to dominate the National League this season, and there is good reason for it. They are a very deep and talented team that should be able to compete with anyone in the league.</p>
