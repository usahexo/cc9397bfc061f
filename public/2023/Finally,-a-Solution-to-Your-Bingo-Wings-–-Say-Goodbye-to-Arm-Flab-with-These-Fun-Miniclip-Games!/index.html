You can do them in just 5 minutes a day, and they’re easy to follow.</p>
<p>The first workout is the couch stretch. To do this workout, you’ll need a timer and something to stretch with. Start by setting your timer for 5 minutes. Then, sit on the edge of your couch with your left leg outstretched and your right leg bent so that your foot is flat on the floor. Place your left hand on top of your thigh and use your right hand to reach around and hold onto your left hamstring. Gently pull yourself closer to your left thigh as you keep your back straight. Hold this position for 30 seconds, then switch legs and repeat.</p>
<p>The next workout is the wall sit. Start by standing with your back against a wall, then slowly slide down until your thighs are parallel with the ground. Hold this position for 30 seconds, then release and stand up.</p>
<p>The third workout is the chair dip. Sit in a chair with both palms flat on the edge of the chair, then slowly lift yourself off the chair so that you’re supporting yourself with just your hands. Bend your knees until they form 90-degree angles, then press down into the chair to raise yourself back up to starting position. Repeat 10 times.</p>
<p>The fourth workout is the plank. Get into a push-up position but instead of resting on your palms, place them directly under your shoulders so that your body forms a straight line from head to heels. Brace your abs and hold for 30 seconds. If this is too difficult, start by doing 3 or 4 reps at a time and work up to 30 seconds over time.</p>
<p>The fifth and final workout is the bridge pose. Lie flat on your back with feet flat on the ground and shoulder-width apart, legs bent to 90 degrees. Drive throughyour heels to lift your torso and upper legs into the air, extendingyour hips until thighs and torso are in line with each other – hold for two seconds . lowerset;10)</p>

No, not the kind that let you fly – we’re talking about those excess flaps of skin on your upper arms that make your T-shirt sleeves ride up. You’re not alone. A lot of women have this problem, and it can really bring down their confidence levels. But there’s good news: with a little bit of effort, you can get rid of your bingo wings for good!</p>
<p>These exercises from Miniclip are a great place to start:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Tricep dips: This is a classic exercise for toning your triceps. Sit on the edge of a bench or chair, with your palms facing forward and your legs bent. Push yourself up so that your weight is supported by your hands and feet, then slowly lower yourself down until your elbows are at a 90-degree angle. Pause briefly at the bottom of the movement, then push yourself back up to the starting position. Repeat 10-12 times.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Resistance band tricep extensions: Wrap a resistance band around a sturdy post or door frame, and stand facing away from it with your feet hip-width apart. Hold one end of the band in each hand, then extend your arms straight out in front of you.Keeping your elbows stationary, slowly curl the bands upward until they reach shoulder height. Pause briefly before slowly lowering them back to the starting position. Repeat 10-12 times.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Seated shoulder press: Sit upright with weights in each hand, palms facing forward. Press the weights straight overhead until your arms are fully extended, then slowly lower them back to the starting position. Keep your core engaged throughout the exercise to protect your back. Repeat 10-12 times.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Upright row: This exercise works all of the muscles in your upper body, including your biceps and shoulders. Holding weights in each hand, stand with your feet hip-width apart and bend at the waist so that your torso is parallel to the floor. Pull the weights up towards your chest, keeping them close to your body and ensuring that you only use your shoulder muscles – avoid using momentum from swinging the weights upwards. Pause briefly before lowering them back to the starting position. Repeat 10-12 times</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>5.. Lat pulldowns: Position yourself at a lat pulldown machine so that the bar is hanging just above eye level and grab it with an overhand grip (palms facing away from you). Lean back slightly and pull the bar down towards the top of your chest while keepingyour elbows tucked into your sides – don’t let them flare outwards). Pause briefly before returning to the starting position., Repeat 10-12 times</p>

No need to worry anymore! There are plenty of fun and easy mini clip games that can help you get rid of them in no time.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>“Boom Boom Volleyball” is a great game to start with. It’s simple to play, and all you need is a beach ball and some space. The goal is to keep the ball in the air as long as possible, and you score a point each time it touches the ground on your opponent’s side. This game is a great workout for your arms and shoulders, and it will help reduce the size of your bingo wings in no time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>“Angry Birds” is another classic mini clip game that is perfect for getting rid of bingo wings. The objective is to use a slingshot to launch birds at various structures in order to destroy them and collect the eggs inside. This game works your upper body muscles as you attempt to achieve maximum power with each shot.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you’re looking for something a bit more challenging, try “Fruit Ninja”. In this game, you must slice fruit that is thrown into the air using a ninja sword. It may seem easy at first, but as the levels progress, the fruit becomes harder to cut and there are more obstacles in your way. This game will help tone your arms and shoulders while also providing a good cardio workout.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Finally, “Candy Crush Saga” is another popular mini clip game that can help get rid of those pesky bingo wings. In this game, you must match three or more candies of the same color in order to clear them from the board. As you progress through the levels, the candies become harder to match, so you’ll have to work hard to achieve high scores. This game is great for toning your arms and wrists.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So don’t let those bingo wings hold you back from having fun anymore! These mini clip games are sure to help reduce their size and make you look and feel great.</p>
