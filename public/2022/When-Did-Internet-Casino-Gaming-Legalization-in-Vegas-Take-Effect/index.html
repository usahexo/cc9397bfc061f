      		<h1 id="When-Did-Internet-Casino-Gaming-Legalization-in-Vegas-Take-Effect"><a href="#When-Did-Internet-Casino-Gaming-Legalization-in-Vegas-Take-Effect" class="headerlink" title="When Did Internet Casino Gaming Legalization in Vegas Take Effect?"></a>When Did Internet Casino Gaming Legalization in Vegas Take Effect?</h1><p>The legalization of casino-style gaming on the internet in Las Vegas happened back in March 2013. This change in law allowed for online poker, blackjack, and slot games to be played from within the boundaries of the Silver State.</p>
<p>As a result of this new legislation, Nevada casinos were able to apply for an Interactive Gaming License. This license would then allow them to offer their services to online players across the globe.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, it wasn’t just land-based casinos who were able to capitalize on this new opportunity. Online gambling platforms and providers also began popping up all around the city. Some of these platforms included the likes of 888 Holdings and Ultimate Gaming.</p>
<h1 id="How-Did-Nevada-Benefit-From-Internet-Casino-Gaming-Legalization"><a href="#How-Did-Nevada-Benefit-From-Internet-Casino-Gaming-Legalization" class="headerlink" title="How Did Nevada Benefit From Internet Casino Gaming Legalization?"></a>How Did Nevada Benefit From Internet Casino Gaming Legalization?</h1><p>There were a few clear benefits that came as a result of internet casino gaming legalization in Vegas. Firstly, Nevada was now able to attract more tourists who were looking to gamble online. Secondly, this also created new job opportunities in the city – particularly for those with experience in iGaming platforms and services. Finally, the state was also able to generate additional tax revenue from these activities.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Becomes-the-First-State-to-License-and-Regulate-Online-Casinos"><a href="#Nevada-Becomes-the-First-State-to-License-and-Regulate-Online-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Becomes the First State to License and Regulate Online Casinos"></a>Nevada Becomes the First State to License and Regulate Online Casinos</h1><p>On June 15, 2017, Nevada became the first state to license and regulate online casinos. Governor Brian Sandoval, a Republican, signed the bill into law. The regulations will go into effect on January 1, 2018.</p>
<p>Under the new law, only licensed casino companies in Nevada will be allowed to offer online gambling. These companies will be required to pay a licensing fee and comply with a number of regulations, including age verification and geo-location requirements.</p>
<p>Players must be physically located in Nevada in order to play at an online casino. This prevents players from outside of Nevada from engaging in illegal gambling activity.</p>
<p>Governor Sandoval said that the new law would create jobs and bring in additional tax revenue for the state. He also praised the fact that it would help protect Nevadans from scams and illegal activities.</p>
<p>Many casino companies have expressed interest in offering online gambling in Nevada. Some of these companies are already operating in other states where online gambling is legal, such as New Jersey and Delaware.</p>
<h1 id="What-led-to-the-legalization-of-internet-casino-gambling-in-Nevada"><a href="#What-led-to-the-legalization-of-internet-casino-gambling-in-Nevada" class="headerlink" title="What led to the legalization of internet casino gambling in Nevada?"></a>What led to the legalization of internet casino gambling in Nevada?</h1><p>The legalization of internet casino gambling in Nevada can be traced back to the early 1990s. In 1991, the state of Nevada legalized casino gaming on the internet and became one of the first states in the US to do so. At that time, very few people were using the internet and there were no laws regulating online gaming.</p>
<p>In 1995, Congress passed the Gaming Act, which prohibited gambling over the internet. However, this law was repealed in 1997 by the Internet Gambling Freedom and Personal Responsibility Act. This act allowed states to legalize and regulate internet gambling within their borders.</p>
<p>Nevada was one of the first states to take advantage of this new law and began regulating online casinos in 1998. The first online casino to receive a license from Nevada was InterCasino. Over the years, Nevada has continued to be a leader in regulating internet gaming and has been at the forefront of efforts to legalize online poker.</p>
<h1 id="When-will-other-states-follow-Nevada’s-lead-and-legalize-internet-casino-gaming"><a href="#When-will-other-states-follow-Nevada’s-lead-and-legalize-internet-casino-gaming" class="headerlink" title="When will other states follow Nevada’s lead and legalize internet casino gaming?"></a>When will other states follow Nevada’s lead and legalize internet casino gaming?</h1><p>It’s been a little more than a week since Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval signed off on Senate Bill 226, legalizing internet-based casino gaming in the state. So far, reactions to the news have been largely positive, with many industry analysts predicting that the new law could help Nevada’s casino industry revive its flagging fortunes.</p>
<p>But when will other states follow Nevada’s lead and legalize internet casino gambling?</p>
<p>That’s difficult to say, as there is no one-size-fits-all answer. Some states may move quickly to legalize online casinos, while others may take a more cautious approach.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure: the trend towards online gambling is unmistakable. In recent years, numerous countries – including Canada, France, and Italy – have legalized some form of online gambling. And in the United States, several states – including Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania – have already legalized online casino gaming.</p>
<p>So it’s only a matter of time before more states follow suit. And when they do, the revenue potential from internet casino gaming will be huge.</p>
<p>Just how big? Well, according to one study, global revenue from online gambling could exceed $60 billion by 2020. That’s a lot of money up for grabs!</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for an investment opportunity with big upside potential, then legalized internet casino gaming may be worth considering.</p>
<h1 id="Get-all-the-latest-news-on-the-legalization-of-internet-casino-gaming-in-Vegas"><a href="#Get-all-the-latest-news-on-the-legalization-of-internet-casino-gaming-in-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="Get all the latest news on the legalization of internet casino gaming in Vegas!"></a>Get all the latest news on the legalization of internet casino gaming in Vegas!</h1><p>Las Vegas is preparing for a possible new industry that could be coming to the city – internet casino gaming. While the legality of this type of gaming is still up in the air, there is buzz that this could be the next big thing for Sin City. If it does end up being legalized, what would this mean for Las Vegas?</p>
<p>First and foremost, if internet casino gaming were to be legalized in Las Vegas, it would likely bring in a lot of revenue for the city. This is because people from all over the world would be able to access casinos from their homes, and there would be no need to travel to Las Vegas in order to enjoy some gambling action. In fact, it’s been estimated that the global online gambling market is worth an impressive $45 billion. Clearly, if Las Vegas can tap into even a small percentage of this market, it would be a major boon for the city.</p>
<p>In addition to generating much-needed revenue, legalizing internet casino gaming could also help to create jobs in Las Vegas. This is another area where Sin City could really shine, as many people are already employed in the casino industry. With internet casino gaming becoming legal, even more jobs could be created – everything from customer service representatives to software developers. This would be a huge win for Las Vegas, as it would help to further diversify its economy and make it less reliant on tourism.</p>
<p>There are also some who believe that legalizing internet casino gaming could help to combat problem gambling in Las Vegas. This is because people who have problems with gambling might be less likely to visit a physical casino if they can gamble online from the comfort of their own home. It’s worth noting that not everyone agrees with this theory, but it’s something that should definitely be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>So far, there has been no concrete news about whether or not internet casino gaming will actually be legalized in Las Vegas. However, there is certainly a lot of buzz about it and many people are keeping their fingers crossed that it will happen. If it does end up being legalized, it will certainly revolutionize the gambling scene in Sin City – and that’s something that everyone should get excited about!</p>
