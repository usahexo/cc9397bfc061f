      		<h1 id="5-Cab-Ride-from-Sands-to-Holiday-Inn-Express-Casino-Black-Jack"><a href="#5-Cab-Ride-from-Sands-to-Holiday-Inn-Express-Casino-Black-Jack" class="headerlink" title="$5 Cab Ride from Sands to Holiday Inn Express Casino Black Jack"></a>$5 Cab Ride from Sands to Holiday Inn Express Casino Black Jack</h1><p>I was in Las Vegas for a conference and was looking for a cheap way to get from the Sands Casino to the Holiday Inn Express on Casino Drive. I asked around and got mixed advice, but in the end I took a $5 Cab Ride from Sands to Holiday Inn Express Casino Black Jack.</p>
<p>The cab ride was pretty uneventful, and it only took about 10 minutes. The driver was friendly and chatty, and we talked about all sorts of things. Overall it was a great experience, and I’d definitely recommend it if you’re looking for an affordable way to get around town.</p>
<h1 id="10-Cab-Ride-from-Sands-to-Holiday-Inn-Express-Casino-Black-Jack"><a href="#10-Cab-Ride-from-Sands-to-Holiday-Inn-Express-Casino-Black-Jack" class="headerlink" title="$10 Cab Ride from Sands to Holiday Inn Express Casino Black Jack"></a>$10 Cab Ride from Sands to Holiday Inn Express Casino Black Jack</h1><p>As I exit the Sands I am struck by the glitz and glamour of the Vegas Strip. The lights, the people, and the sound all combine to create a sensory overload. After orienting myself, I hail a cab for the short ride to my hotel, the Holiday Inn Express Casino Black Jack.</p>
<p>Upon arriving at my destination, I am pleasantly surprised. The Holiday Inn is a modern, high-rise hotel located in the heart of the Strip. My room is spacious and comfortable with a great view of the cityscape.</p>
<p>After settling in, I head down to the casino for some fun. The blackjack tables are lively and there’s plenty of action to be had. I quickly lose my $10 stake, but that’s ok – it was just for fun anyways.</p>
<p>I then retire to my room for a good night’s sleep. The bed is amazingly comfortable and I quickly drift off into a deep slumber.</p>
<p>In the morning I awake refreshed and ready to tackle another day in Las Vegas. After breakfast in the hotel restaurant, I head out into the city to explore some more.</p>
<p>The Holiday Inn Express Casino Black Jack is an excellent place to stay in Las Vegas – it’s affordable, comfortable, and centrally located on the Strip. I would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Sin City!</p>
<h1 id="15-Cab-Ride-from-Sands-to-Holiday-Inn-Express-Casino-Black-Jack"><a href="#15-Cab-Ride-from-Sands-to-Holiday-Inn-Express-Casino-Black-Jack" class="headerlink" title="$15 Cab Ride from Sands to Holiday Inn Express Casino Black Jack"></a>$15 Cab Ride from Sands to Holiday Inn Express Casino Black Jack</h1><p>I found a great spot to play black jack at the Sands Casino. The $15 cab ride from the casino to the Holiday Inn Express was worth it. I’m writing this article on my laptop in my room at the Holiday Inn Express. I’m sipping on a cold Budweiser and enjoying some of the free snacks they provide. I’m going to go downstairs and get something to eat. I’ll be back in a bit.</p>
<p>I just got back from eating at the casino buffet. It was pretty good, but not as good as the one at the Mirage. I’m sitting here in my room at the Holiday Inn Express, getting ready to go downstairs and play some more black jack. I just need to take a quick shower first.</p>
<p>I just got back from playing black jack at the Sands Casino. I didn’t do too well, but it was still fun. The $15 cab ride from the casino to the Holiday Inn Express was worth it. I’m sitting here in my room, typing this article on my laptop, enjoying a cold Budweiser and some free snacks. I’m going to go downstairs and get something to eat now. I’ll be back in a bit.</p>
<p>I just got back from eating at the casino buffet again. It was pretty good, but not as good as the one at the Mirage. I’m going to go downstairs and play some more black jack now.</p>
<h1 id="20-Cab-Ride-from-Sands-to-Holiday-Inn-Express-Casino-Black-Jack"><a href="#20-Cab-Ride-from-Sands-to-Holiday-Inn-Express-Casino-Black-Jack" class="headerlink" title="$20 Cab Ride from Sands to Holiday Inn Express Casino Black Jack"></a>$20 Cab Ride from Sands to Holiday Inn Express Casino Black Jack</h1><p>I was in Las Vegas for a conference and had some time to kill so I decided to go to the casino. I’m not a big gambler, but I do enjoy playing blackjack. I walked from the Sands Expo Center to the Mirage, then over to the Venetian. I didn’t want to spend all day walking, so I took a cab from the Venetian to the Holiday Inn Express on Boulder Highway. The cost was $20 plus tip.</p>
<p>The ride took about 15 minutes, and the driver was very nice. He even helped me with my luggage. The Holiday Inn Express is a short walk from the casino, and there’s a free shuttle service that runs every 30 minutes or so.</p>
<p>The casino has all of your typical games - blackjack, roulette, craps, etc. - as well as a few less common ones like Spanish 21 and Pai Gow Poker. The minimum bet for blackjack is $5, which is about average for Las Vegas casinos.</p>
<p>I didn’t win anything big, but I had a lot of fun playing blackjack and trying out some of the other games. If you’re looking for a cheap way to get from Sands Expo Center to the Holiday Inn Express Casino, taking a cab is definitely the way to go.</p>
<h1 id="25-Cab-Ride-from-Sands-to-Holiday-Inn-Express-Casino-Black-Jack"><a href="#25-Cab-Ride-from-Sands-to-Holiday-Inn-Express-Casino-Black-Jack" class="headerlink" title="$25 Cab Ride from Sands to Holiday Inn Express Casino Black Jack"></a>$25 Cab Ride from Sands to Holiday Inn Express Casino Black Jack</h1><p>I was on my way to play black jack at the Sands Casino in Bethlehem, PA. I had never been there before, but I had heard it was a great casino. I got off of the elevator on the second floor and saw a large crowd of people at the black jack table. I decided to watch for a few minutes to see if it was something that I wanted to get into. After about 10 minutes, I decided that it didn’t look too complicated and went to the cashier to get some chips.</p>
<p>After playing for a while and losing a bit more than I wanted to, I decided to go walk around and check out some of the other games. There wasn’t much else going on at that time so I went back to the black jack table. A few minutes later, somebody left and they had an open seat, so I sat down.</p>
<p>A short time later, a guy came up to me and asked if he could sit next to me. He introduced himself as Joe and said he was from Philly. We started talking and he started teaching me how to play blackjack. After playing for a while longer, we were both up money so we decided to call it a night.</p>
<p>I went back upstairs to the elevator and hit the button, but nothing happened. Then I remembered that Sands Casino is on the second floor of the hotel/casino, not just the casino like most other places. So I went back downstairs and out the door where I saw a sign for cabs. There was one waiting so I got in.</p>
<p>The driver asked where I wanted to go and I told him Holiday Inn Express Casino in Black Jack, which is about 5 minutes away from Sands Casino according to Google Maps. The fare ended up being $25 even though it’s only about 3 miles according to Google Maps (I’m assuming there was a toll).</p>
<p>Overall, it was an enjoyable experience and I would recommend Sands Casino if you’re in the area or looking for a place to play blackjack.</p>
