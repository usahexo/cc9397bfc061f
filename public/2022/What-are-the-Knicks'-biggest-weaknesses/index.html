                <h1>What are the Knicks' biggest weaknesses</h1>
            </div>

        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      		<h1 id="What-are-the-Knicks’-biggest-weaknesses"><a href="#What-are-the-Knicks’-biggest-weaknesses" class="headerlink" title="What are the Knicks’ biggest weaknesses?"></a>What are the Knicks’ biggest weaknesses?</h1><p>In the 2016-2017 season, the Knicks had some glaring weaknesses that derailed their playoff hopes. Their biggest weakness was their lack of shooting. Kristaps Porzingis was the only player on the Knicks who could consistently hit from beyond the arc. Courtney Lee was their next best shooter, and he only shot 34 percent from three-point range. Derrick Rose, Carmelo Anthony, and Joakim Noah were all inefficient shooters who often forced bad shots.</p>
<p>Another big weakness for the Knicks was their defense. They struggled to stop teams from scoring in the paint and allowed too many fast break points. This was due in part to their lack of length and athleticism. The Knicks also had trouble defending guards who could penetrate and score in isolation.</p>
<p>If the Knicks want to make the playoffs in 2017-2018, they will need to address these weaknesses. They should try to add more shooters in free agency or through trade, and they need to improve their defensive rotations and perimeter defense.</p>
<h1 id="What-can-the-Knicks-do-to-improve-their-offense"><a href="#What-can-the-Knicks-do-to-improve-their-offense" class="headerlink" title="What can the Knicks do to improve their offense?"></a>What can the Knicks do to improve their offense?</h1><p>The New York Knicks finished the 2017-2018 season with a 29-53 record, which was good for 11th place in the Eastern Conference. They were one of the worst offensive teams in the league, ranking 26th in points per game (101.3) and 26th in offensive rating (104.0).</p>
<p>There are a few things that the Knicks can do to improve their offense. First, they need to get better players. Kristaps Porzingis is a very talented player, but he can’t do it all by himself. They also need to improve their shooting. The Knicks ranked 24th in three-point percentage (35.3%) last season.</p>
<p>Another thing that they can do is improve their ball movement. The Knicks averaged 18.5 assists per game last season, which was good for 22nd in the league. They need to move the ball more and take advantage of their open shots.</p>
<p>If the Knicks can improve their offense, they should be able to compete for a playoff spot next season.</p>
<h1 id="What-can-the-Knicks-do-to-improve-their-defense"><a href="#What-can-the-Knicks-do-to-improve-their-defense" class="headerlink" title="What can the Knicks do to improve their defense?"></a>What can the Knicks do to improve their defense?</h1><p>The Knicks’ defense was one of the worst in the NBA last season. They allowed 108.3 points per game, which was 28th in the league. They also allowed opponents to shoot 47% from the field, which was also 28th in the league.</p>
<p>So what can the Knicks do to improve their defense? Here are five things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get more athletic</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the biggest problems for the Knicks’ defense last season was that they were not very athletic. They lacked perimeter defenders who could stay with opposing guards, and they lacked big men who could protect the rim.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this is a problem that can be fixed relatively easily. The Knicks should target athletic players in free agency and the draft, and they should also try to get more athletic by playing quicker lineups.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Add more experience</li>
</ol>
<p>Another issue for the Knicks’ defense last season was that they were quite young and inexperienced. This showed especially on plays where they were forced to make defensive rotations.</p>
<p>Adding some veterans who have experience playing defense in the NBA could help solve this problem. Players like Andre Iguodala or Joe Johnson would be great additions to this team, because they would not only be able to contribute on offense, but they would also be able to teach the younger players how to play better defense.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Improve their rebounding</li>
</ol>
<p>The Knicks were also terrible at rebounding last season. They averaged just 40 rebounds per game, which was dead last in the NBA. This lack of rebounding ultimately led to too many second chance opportunities for their opponents.</p>
<p> improving their rebounding should be one of their top priorities this offseason. They could do this by signing a couple of good rebounders in free agency, or by drafting players like Harry Giles or John Collins who are known for their prowess on the boards.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Play smarter defensively</li>
</ol>
<p>The Knicks also need to play smarter defensively if they want to improve their results on that end of the floor. This means avoiding silly fouls, gambling on steals, and getting out of position unnecessarily. If they can clean up these mistakes, it will go a long way towards making them a better defensive team.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-key-to-beating-the-Knicks"><a href="#What-is-the-key-to-beating-the-Knicks" class="headerlink" title="What is the key to beating the Knicks?"></a>What is the key to beating the Knicks?</h1><p>The Knicks have always been a thorn in the side of the Golden State Warriors. The Dubs are on a mission to finally overcome their nemesis this season. What is the key to beating the Knicks?</p>
<p>There are many things that the Warriors need to do in order to beat the Knicks. First and foremost, they need to control the tempo of the game. If they let the Knicks run and score in transition, it will be a long night for Golden State. They also need to take care of the ball and limit their turnovers. If they turn the ball over too often, the Knicks will take advantage and score easy points.</p>
<p>Another important factor is rebounding. The Warriors need to out-rebound the Knicks if they want to win this game. Finally, they need to play with energy and intensity from start to finish. If they come out flat like they did against Phoenix, they will lose to New York.</p>
<p>The Warriors have all of the tools necessary to beat the Knicks. It all comes down to execution. If they play as a team and focus on playing their game, they will come away with a victory.</p>
<h1 id="How-can-the-Knicks-make-a-deeper-playoff-run"><a href="#How-can-the-Knicks-make-a-deeper-playoff-run" class="headerlink" title="How can the Knicks make a deeper playoff run?"></a>How can the Knicks make a deeper playoff run?</h1><p>The New York Knicks are coming off a disappointing season in which they were unable to make it out of the first round of the playoffs. This offseason, the Knicks have made some changes in an effort to improve their team and make a deeper playoff run.</p>
<p>One of the biggest changes was hiring David Fizdale as their head coach. Fizdale is known for his coaching ability and his ability to get the most out of his players. He is also known for his strong defensive mindset, which could help the Knicks improve on their poor defensive performance from last season.</p>
<p>Another change the Knicks made this offseason was trading away Carmelo Anthony. This move opens up opportunities for other players on the team, such as Kristaps Porzingis and Tim Hardaway Jr. Both Porzingis and Hardaway Jr. struggled last season with Carmelo Anthony taking up a lot of the offensive workload. With Anthony gone, they should have more opportunities to score and should be able to play better as a team.</p>
<p>The Knicks also made some additions to their roster this offseason, including Trey Burke and Enes Kanter. Burke is a talented point guard who can score and distribute the ball effectively. Kanter is a strong rebounder who will give the Knicks much-needed frontcourt depth.</p>
<p>Overall, the Knicks have made some significant changes this offseason that should help them improve their team and make a deeper playoff run. If they can gel together as a team and play well defensively, they could be one of the surprises of the NBA this season.</p>
