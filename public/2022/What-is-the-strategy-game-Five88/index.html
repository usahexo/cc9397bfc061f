There are two players, each player has 44 pieces. The game begins with an empty board. The object of the game is to form five squares in a row, column, or diagonal.</p>
<p>Pieces can move one square in any direction, except for diagonally backwards. A piece can capture an opponent’s piece by jumping over it and landing on an empty square behind the opponent’s piece.

<p>The game is won by either player when the other player has no pieces remaining on the board or when one player forms five squares in a row, column, or diagonal.</p>
