The object of the game is to score points by taking as many cards as possible to be equal to, or one more than, the total value of the player’s hand at the end of the hand. The game is played with a regular deck of 52 cards. Aces are worth 1 point, 2s through 10s are worth face value, and a Jack, Queen or King (J,Q,K) are each worth 10 points.\n\nThe first player begins by dealing six cards face down in a row in front of them. The remaining cards are placed in a face down stack next to the player. The second player then deals six cards face down in front of themselves. These twelve cards form each player’s initial hand. \n\nOn a player’s turn they draw one card from either the deck or from their opponent’s hand and must play one. Cards of the same rank as the card played (e.g., two 4s) cancel each other out and are removed from play. After playing a card, if the player has no more cards in their hand they draw one from the deck to bring their hand back up to six cards. When both players have no more cards left in their hands, both players select three cards from their row of six and put them into their scoring pile. The other three go back into their row, reshuffled and re-dealt for the next round.\n\nThe winner is the first player to reach 100 points or more OR when the opponent cannot play without going over 100 points; that player automatically wins the game.\n\n#  What are the features of Lobby Game and Lobby Gamesys Slots?\n\nThe Lobby Game and Lobby Gamesys Slots are two of the most popular casino games in the world. They share many of the same features, but there are some key differences that set them apart. In this article, we will take a look at the features of both games and see how they compare.\n\nThe Lobby Game is a classic casino game that has been around for centuries. It is a card game that is played with a deck of 52 cards. The objective of the game is to beat the dealer's hand by either getting a higher score than the dealer or by getting blackjack (a card with an ace and a ten point value).\n\nLobby Gamesys Slots is a newer game that was developed in the early 2000s. It is a slot machine game that is based on traditional slot machines. However, it features several bonus rounds that make it more exciting than traditional slot machines.\n\nBoth games are popular among casino players, but they each have their own unique set of features that make them appealing.

The object of the game is to score points by taking as many cards as possible to be equal to, or one more than, the total value of the player’s hand at the end of the hand. The game is played with a regular deck of 52 cards. Aces are worth 1 point, 2s through 10s are worth face value, and a Jack, Queen or King (J,Q,K) are each worth 10 points.</p>\n<p>The first player begins by dealing six cards face down in a row in front of them. The remaining cards are placed in a face down stack next to the player. The second player then deals six cards face down in front of themselves. These twelve cards form each player’s initial hand. </p>\n<p>On a player’s turn they draw one card from either the deck or from their opponent’s hand and must play one. Cards of the same rank as the card played (e.g., two 4s) cancel each other out and are removed from play. After playing a card, if the player has no more cards in their hand they draw one from the deck to bring their hand back up to six cards. When both players have no more cards left in their hands, both players select three cards from their row of six and put them into their scoring pile. The other three go back into their row, reshuffled and re-dealt for the next round.</p>\n<p>The winner is the first player to reach 100 points or more OR when the opponent cannot play without going over 100 points; that player automatically wins the game.</p>\n<h1 id=\"What-are-the-features-of-Lobby-Game-and-Lobby-Gamesys-Slots\"><a href=\"#What-are-the-features-of-Lobby-Game-and-Lobby-Gamesys-Slots\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What are the features of Lobby Game and Lobby Gamesys Slots?\"></a>What are the features of Lobby Game and Lobby Gamesys Slots?</h1><p>The Lobby Game and Lobby Gamesys Slots are two of the most popular casino games in the world. They share many of the same features, but there are some key differences that set them apart. In this article, we will take a look at the features of both games and see how they compare.</p>\n<p>The Lobby Game is a classic casino game that has been around for centuries. It is a card game that is played with a deck of 52 cards. The objective of the game is to beat the dealer’s hand by either getting a higher score than the dealer or by getting blackjack (a card with an ace and a ten point value).</p>\n<p>Lobby Gamesys Slots is a newer game that was developed in the early 2000s. It is a slot machine game that is based on traditional slot machines. However, it features several bonus rounds that make it more exciting than traditional slot machines.</p>\n<p>Both games are popular among casino players, but they each have their own unique set of features that make them appealing. Let’s take a closer look at some of the key differences between these two games.</p>\n<p>One of the main differences between Lobby Game and Lobby Gamesys Slots is the way they are played. The Lobby Game is a card game that requires strategy and skill, while Lobby Gamesys Slots is a slot machine game that relies mainly on luck. This means that players who enjoy strategy games will prefer playing the Lobby Game, while players who enjoy fast-paced games will prefer playing Lobby Gamesys Slots.</p>\n<p>Another difference between these two games is the stakes involved. The Lobby Game can be played for low or high stakes, while Lobby Gamesys Slots usually has higher stakes because of its bonus rounds. This makes the Lobby Game more appealing to casual players, while serious gamers will prefer playing Lobby Gamesys Slots because it offers bigger payouts.</p>\n<p>Finally, one of the key differences between these two games is their graphics. The graphics in Lobby Game are simple and dated, while those in Lobby Gamesys Slots are more modern and exciting. This makes Lobby Gamesys Slots more appealing to younger players, while older players may prefer playing Lodgeamaid because it has a classic feel to it</p>\n"},{"title":"What are the Knicks' biggest weaknesses","date":"2022-10-05T03:15:34.000Z","_content":"\n\n#  What are the Knicks' biggest weaknesses?\n\nIn the 2016-2017 season, the Knicks had some glaring weaknesses that derailed their playoff hopes. Their biggest weakness was their lack of shooting. Kristaps Porzingis was the only player on the Knicks who could consistently hit from beyond the arc. Courtney Lee was their next best shooter, and he only shot 34 percent from three-point range. Derrick Rose, Carmelo Anthony, and Joakim Noah were all inefficient shooters who often forced bad shots.\n\nAnother big weakness for the Knicks was their defense. They struggled to stop teams from scoring in the paint and allowed too many fast break points. This was due in part to their lack of length and athleticism. The Knicks also had trouble defending guards who could penetrate and score in isolation.\n\nIf the Knicks want to make the playoffs in 2017-2018, they will need to address these weaknesses. They should try to add more shooters in free agency or through trade, and they need to improve their defensive rotations and perimeter defense.\n\n#  What can the Knicks do to improve their offense?\n\nThe New York Knicks finished the 2017-2018 season with a 29-53 record, which was good for 11th place in the Eastern Conference. They were one of the worst offensive teams in the league, ranking 26th in points per game (101.3) and 26th in offensive rating (104.0).\n\nThere are a few things that the Knicks can do to improve their offense. First, they need to get better players. Kristaps Porzingis is a very talented player, but he can't do it all by himself. They also need to improve their shooting. The Knicks ranked 24th in three-point percentage (35.3%) last season.\n\nAnother thing that they can do is improve their ball movement. The Knicks averaged 18.5 assists per game last season, which was good for 22nd in the league. They need to move the ball more and take advantage of their open shots.\n\nIf the Knicks can improve their offense, they should be able to compete for a playoff spot next season.\n\n#  What can the Knicks do to improve their defense?\n\nThe Knicks' defense was one of the worst in the NBA last season. They allowed 108.3 points per game, which was 28th in the league. They also allowed opponents to shoot 47% from the field, which was also 28th in the league.\n\nSo what can the Knicks do to improve their defense? Here are five things:\n\n1. Get more athletic\n\nOne of the biggest problems for the Knicks' defense last season was that they were not very athletic. They lacked perimeter defenders who could stay with opposing guards, and they lacked big men who could protect the rim.\n\nFortunately, this is a problem that can be fixed relatively easily. The Knicks should target athletic players in free agency and the draft, and they should also try to get more athletic by playing quicker lineups.\n\n2. Add more experience\n\nAnother issue for the Knicks' defense last season was that they were quite young and inexperienced. This showed especially on plays where they were forced to make defensive rotations.\n\nAdding some veterans who have experience playing defense in the NBA could help solve this problem. Players like Andre Iguodala or Joe Johnson would be great additions to this team, because they would not only be able to contribute on offense, but they would also be able to teach the younger players how to play better defense.\n\n3. Improve their rebounding\n\nThe Knicks were also terrible at rebounding last season. They averaged just 40 rebounds per game, which was dead last in the NBA. This lack of rebounding ultimately led to too many second chance opportunities for their opponents.\n\n improving their rebounding should be one of their top priorities this offseason. They could do this by signing a couple of good rebounders in free agency, or by drafting players like Harry Giles or John Collins who are known for their prowess on the boards.\n\n4. Play smarter defensively\n\nThe Knicks also need to play smarter defensively if they want to improve their results on that end of the floor. This means avoiding silly fouls, gambling on steals, and getting out of position unnecessarily. If they can clean up these mistakes, it will go a long way towards making them a better defensive team.\n\n#  What is the key to beating the Knicks?\n\nThe Knicks have always been a thorn in the side of the Golden State Warriors. The Dubs are on a mission to finally overcome their nemesis this season. What is the key to beating the Knicks?\n\nThere are many things that the Warriors need to do in order to beat the Knicks. First and foremost, they need to control the tempo of the game. If they let the Knicks run and score in transition, it will be a long night for Golden State. They also need to take care of the ball and limit their turnovers. If they turn the ball over too often, the Knicks will take advantage and score easy points.\n\nAnother important factor is rebounding. The Warriors need to out-rebound the Knicks if they want to win this game. Finally, they need to play with energy and intensity from start to finish. If they come out flat like they did against Phoenix, they will lose to New York.\n\nThe Warriors have all of the tools necessary to beat the Knicks. It all comes down to execution. If they play as a team and focus on playing their game, they will come away with a victory.\n\n#  How can the Knicks make a deeper playoff run?\n\nThe New York Knicks are coming off a disappointing season in which they were unable to make it out of the first round of the playoffs. This offseason, the Knicks have made some changes in an effort to improve their team and make a deeper playoff run.\n\nOne of the biggest changes was hiring David Fizdale as their head coach. Fizdale is known for his coaching ability and his ability to get the most out of his players. He is also known for his strong defensive mindset, which could help the Knicks improve on their poor defensive performance from last season.\n\nAnother change the Knicks made this offseason was trading away Carmelo Anthony. This move opens up opportunities for other players on the team, such as Kristaps Porzingis and Tim Hardaway Jr. Both Porzingis and Hardaway Jr. struggled last season with Carmelo Anthony taking up a lot of the offensive workload. With Anthony gone, they should have more opportunities to score and should be able to play better as a team.\n\nThe Knicks also made some additions to their roster this offseason, including Trey Burke and Enes Kanter. Burke is a talented point guard who can score and distribute the ball effectively. Kanter is a strong rebounder who will give the Knicks much-needed frontcourt depth.\n\nOverall, the Knicks have made some significant changes this offseason that should help them improve their team and make a deeper playoff run. If they can gel together as a team and play well defensively, they could be one of the surprises of the NBA this season.","source":"_posts/What-are-the-Knicks'-biggest-weaknesses.md","raw":"---\ntitle: What are the Knicks' biggest weaknesses\ndate: 2022-10-05 11:15:34\ncategories:\n- Rob Casino\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  What are the Knicks' biggest weaknesses?\n\nIn the 2016-2017 season, the Knicks had some glaring weaknesses that derailed their playoff hopes.

They were one of the worst offensive teams in the league, ranking 26th in points per game (101.3) and 26th in offensive rating (104.0).</p>\n<p>There are a few things that the Knicks can do to improve their offense. First, they need to get better players. Kristaps Porzingis is a very talented player, but he can’t do it all by himself. They also need to improve their shooting. The Knicks ranked 24th in three-point percentage (35.3%) last season.</p>\n<p>Another thing that they can do is improve their ball movement. The Knicks averaged 18.5 assists per game last season, which was good for 22nd in the league. They need to move the ball more and take advantage of their open shots.</p>\n<p>If the Knicks can improve their offense, they should be able to compete for a playoff spot next season.</p>\n<h1 id=\"What-can-the-Knicks-do-to-improve-their-defense\"><a href=\"#What-can-the-Knicks-do-to-improve-their-defense\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What can the Knicks do to improve their defense?\"></a>What can the Knicks do to improve their defense?</h1><p>The Knicks’ defense was one of the worst in the NBA last season. They allowed 108.3 points per game, which was 28th in the league. They also allowed opponents to shoot 47% from the field, which was also 28th in the league.</p>\n<p>So what can the Knicks do to improve their defense? Here are five things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Get more athletic</li>\n</ol>\n<p>One of the biggest problems for the Knicks’ defense last season was that they were not very athletic. They lacked perimeter defenders who could stay with opposing guards, and they lacked big men who could protect the rim.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, this is a problem that can be fixed relatively easily. The Knicks should target athletic players in free agency and the draft, and they should also try to get more athletic by playing quicker lineups.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Add more experience</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Another issue for the Knicks’ defense last season was that they were quite young and inexperienced. This showed especially on plays where they were forced to make defensive rotations.</p>\n<p>Adding some veterans who have experience playing defense in the NBA could help solve this problem. Players like Andre Iguodala or Joe Johnson would be great additions to this team, because they would not only be able to contribute on offense, but they would also be able to teach the younger players how to play better defense.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Improve their rebounding</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Knicks were also terrible at rebounding last season. They averaged just 40 rebounds per game, which was dead last in the NBA. This lack of rebounding ultimately led to too many second chance opportunities for their opponents.</p>\n<p> improving their rebounding should be one of their top priorities this offseason. They could do this by signing a couple of good rebounders in free agency, or by drafting players like Harry Giles or John Collins who are known for their prowess on the boards.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Play smarter defensively</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Knicks also need to play smarter defensively if they want to improve their results on that end of the floor. This means avoiding silly fouls, gambling on steals, and getting out of position unnecessarily. If they can clean up these mistakes, it will go a long way towards making them a better defensive team.</p>\n<h1 id=\"What-is-the-key-to-beating-the-Knicks\"><a href=\"#What-is-the-key-to-beating-the-Knicks\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What is the key to beating the Knicks?\"></a>What is the key to beating the Knicks?</h1><p>The Knicks have always been a thorn in the side of the Golden State Warriors. The Dubs are on a mission to finally overcome their nemesis this season. What is the key to beating the Knicks?</p>\n<p>There are many things that the Warriors need to do in order to beat the Knicks. First and foremost, they need to control the tempo of the game. If they let the Knicks run and score in transition, it will be a long night for Golden State. They also need to take care of the ball and limit their turnovers. If they turn the ball over too often, the Knicks will take advantage and score easy points.</p>\n<p>Another important factor is rebounding. The Warriors need to out-rebound the Knicks if they want to win this game. Finally, they need to play with energy and intensity from start to finish. If they come out flat like they did against Phoenix, they will lose to New York.</p>\n<p>The Warriors have all of the tools necessary to beat the Knicks. It all comes down to execution. If they play as a team and focus on playing their game, they will come away with a victory.</p>\n<h1 id=\"How-can-the-Knicks-make-a-deeper-playoff-run\"><a href=\"#How-can-the-Knicks-make-a-deeper-playoff-run\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"How can the Knicks make a deeper playoff run?\"></a>How can the Knicks make a deeper playoff run?</h1><p>The New York Knicks are coming off a disappointing season in which they were unable to make it out of the first round of the playoffs. This offseason, the Knicks have made some changes in an effort to improve their team and make a deeper playoff run.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest changes was hiring David Fizdale as their head coach. Fizdale is known for his coaching ability and his ability to get the most out of his players. He is also known for his strong defensive mindset, which could help the Knicks improve on their poor defensive performance from last season.</p>\n<p>Another change the Knicks made this offseason was trading away Carmelo Anthony. This move opens up opportunities for other players on the team, such as Kristaps Porzingis and Tim Hardaway Jr. Both Porzingis and Hardaway Jr. struggled last season with Carmelo Anthony taking up a lot of the offensive workload. With Anthony gone, they should have more opportunities to score and should be able to play better as a team.</p>\n<p>The Knicks also made some additions to their roster this offseason, including Trey Burke and Enes Kanter. Burke is a talented point guard who can score and distribute the ball effectively. Kanter is a strong rebounder who will give the Knicks much-needed frontcourt depth.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Knicks have made some significant changes this offseason that should help them improve their team and make a deeper playoff run. If they can gel together as a team and play well defensively, they could be one of the surprises of the NBA this season.</p>\n"},{"title":"12 Types of Online Casino Bonuses and How They Work","date":"2022-10-06T04:35:09.000Z","_content":"\n\n#  12 Types of Online Casino Bonuses and How They Work\n\nWelcome to our comprehensive guide to online casino bonuses!

As players, we’re always on the lookout for the best deals and rewards available, and casinos love to offer bonus promotions in an effort to attract new business. But with so many different types of bonuses available, it can be difficult to know which one is right for you. In this article, we will take a look at some of the most common casino bonuses and help you to decide which one is right for you.\n\n# Match Bonuses \n\nA match bonus is one of the simplest and most common casino bonuses available. This type of bonus matches a percentage of your initial deposit, up to a certain amount. For example, a casino might offer a 100% match bonus up to $200. This means that they will match your deposit dollar for dollar, up to $200. So if you deposit $100, they will give you an additional $100 in bonus money, for a total of $200 in your account.\n\nThis type of bonus is great for players who want to increase their bankrolls without having to risk too much money. And since it is automatically credited to your account upon depositing, there is no need to claim it or redeem any special codes – it’s as easy as it gets! However, there are usually wagering requirements associated with match bonuses, so be sure to read the terms and conditions carefully before accepting one.\n\n# No-Deposit Bonuses \n\nAs the name suggests, no-deposit bonuses are bonuses that are awarded to players without requiring them to make any initial deposits. These bonuses usually come in the form of free spins or free cash, which can be used at the casino’s slots games or table games respectively.\n\nNo-deposit bonuses are a great way for players to try out a new casino without risking any of their own money. And since they don’t require any deposits, they are also perfect for players who want to avoid any unnecessary hassle. However, note that these bonuses usually come with rather high wagering requirements – sometimes as high as 50x! So be sure to factor that into your decision before accepting one.\n\n# Reload Bonuses \n\nReload bonuses are similar in nature to match bonuses – they offer players extra funds when they make additional deposits into their accounts. However, reload bonuses are typically smaller than match bonuses, and come with lower wagering requirements as well. This makes them a great option for casual players who aren’t looking to make large deposits but still want some extra cash to play with.\n\nLike match bonuses, reload bonuses are easy to claim – all you have do is make another deposit and the bonus funds will be automatically added to your account. So if you’re looking for an easy way get some extra cash at your favourite casino site, then look no further than reload bonuses!\n\n#  Understanding Casino Bonuses \n\nCasino bonuses are one of the main ways that casinos attract new customers. They can be extremely lucrative for players, but it's important to understand how they work before you start claiming them. This guide will provide an overview of casino bonuses and explain how to make the most of them.\n\nThe first thing to understand is that there are different types of casino bonus. The most common type is a matched deposit bonus, in which the casino doubles your first deposit up to a certain amount. For example, a casino might offer a 100% matched deposit bonus up to $100. This means that if you deposit $100, the casino will match it and give you another $100 in bonus money.\n\nMany casinos also offer free spins on popular slot machines as part of their bonus offers. These free spins allow you to play slots for free and potentially win real money. Some casinos also offer no-deposit bonuses, which allow you to claim free money without making a deposit.\n\nIt's important to read the terms and conditions of any casino bonus before you claim it. Each bonus has different requirements, and some may be difficult or impossible to cash out. Make sure you understand all of the terms and conditions before signing up for a bonus.\n\nOnce you've claimed a casino bonus, it's important to make the most of it by playing high-value games. Slots usually have lower house edges than other games, so they're ideal for using your casino bonus funds. Be sure to gamble responsibly and always set limits on how much money you're willing to lose.\n\nCasino bonuses can be extremely lucrative, but it's important to understand how they work before claiming one. Make sure you read the terms and conditions carefully and only gamble with money you can afford to lose.\n\n#  Explaining the Most Popular Casino Bonuses\n\nCasino bonuses are one of the main reasons that online casinos have become so popular.

In this article, we will explain the most popular types of casino bonuses and provide you with a few tips on how to make the most of them.</p>\n<p>The first type of casino bonus is the welcome bonus.

This will ensure that you understand how the bonus works and what you need to do in order to clear it. For example, some casinos require players to wager their bonus funds a certain number of times before they can withdraw any winnings. So, if you don’t meet these requirements, you may not be able to cash out your winnings even if you have met all other conditions.</p>\n<p>Tip #2: Use The Bonus Funds To Try Out New Games</p>\n<p>If you are not sure which games you want to play, use your casino bonus funds to try out some new ones. Many casinos offer free spins or complimentary chips that can be used on select games, so take advantage of this and see which ones you like best. You may just find your new favourite game!</p>\n<p>Tip #3: Stick To The Low Staked Games When Waging Your Bonus Funds</p>\n<p>When waging your bonus funds, it is important to stick to low staked games such as blackjack or roulette rather than betting on high variance slots games which could see your entire balance wiped out in just a few spins. This way, you will have more chances of clearing your bonus and winning big jackpots!</p>\n","site":{"data":{}},"excerpt":"","more":"<h1 id=\"12-Types-of-Online-Casino-Bonuses-and-How-They-Work\"><a href=\"#12-Types-of-Online-Casino-Bonuses-and-How-They-Work\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"12 Types of Online Casino Bonuses and How They Work\"></a>12 Types of Online Casino Bonuses and How They Work</h1><p>Welcome to our comprehensive guide to online casino bonuses!
