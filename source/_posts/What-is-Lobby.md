#  What is Lobby?

Lobby is a software development tool that enables distributed teams to collaborate on code more effectively. It provides a shared workspace where developers can chat, share files, and collaborate on code in real time.

Lobby was created by former Google engineer Alec Toys, who was frustrated with the lack of collaborative tools available to distributed teams. He wanted a tool that would allow developers to work together as if they were in the same room, and Lobby was born.

Since its inception, Lobby has become a popular choice for software developers looking for a better way to collaborate. It has been featured in The New York Times, Forbes, and Wired Magazine, and has been used by companies such as Google, Facebook, and Netflix.

# How does Lobby work?

Lobby is built around three core components: chat, files, and code.

The chat feature allows developers to communicate with one another in real time. The file sharing feature enables developers to share files with one another and access them from any device. The code collaboration feature allows developers to co-edit codebase in real time.

All of these features are accessible from a single workspace, which makes it easy for developers to collaborate on code no matter where they are located.

# Who is Lobby for?

Lobby is ideal for distributed teams of developers who need to collaborate on code. It provides a centralized workspace where developers can communicate with one another, share files, and co-edit codebase in real time.

#  How to play Lobby Maupassant?

`

Lobby Maupassant is a two-player card game that is based on the original Maupassant game. The object of the game is to score points by taking as many cards as possible to be equal to, or one more than, the total value of the player’s hand at the end of the hand. The game is played with a regular deck of 52 cards. Aces are worth 1 point, 2s through 10s are worth face value, and a Jack, Queen or King (J,Q,K) are each worth 10 points.

The first player begins by dealing six cards face down in a row in front of them. The remaining cards are placed in a face down stack next to the player. The second player then deals six cards face down in front of themselves. These twelve cards form each player’s initial hand. 

On a player’s turn they draw one card from either the deck or from their opponent’s hand and must play one. Cards of the same rank as the card played (e.g., two 4s) cancel each other out and are removed from play. After playing a card, if the player has no more cards in their hand they draw one from the deck to bring their hand back up to six cards. When both players have no more cards left in their hands, both players select three cards from their row of six and put them into their scoring pile. The other three go back into their row, reshuffled and re-dealt for the next round.

The winner is the first player to reach 100 points or more OR when the opponent cannot play without going over 100 points; that player automatically wins the game.

The Lobby Game is a classic casino game that has been around for centuries. It is a card game that is played with a deck of 52 cards.
