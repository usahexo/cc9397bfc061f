#  Braves' new stadium set to open with a bang as they take on rivals Nationals!

The Braves are back in Atlanta and set to open their brand new stadium this weekend! The $672 million ballpark, which is set to open on April 14 against the Nationals, was built with one main goal in mind - to make Turner Fieldrelevant again.

According to Fox Sports, Braves Executive Vice President of Business Operations Mike Plant said the following about the new stadium: "It had become irrelevant. We were playing in a downtown ballpark that Major League Baseball essentially told us we needed to vacate. It just wasn't baseball-friendly anymore."

The new stadium is definitely baseball-friendly, as it features a 41,500 seat capacity, complete with world-class amenities that will please both fans and players alike. In addition, the surrounding area has been completely redeveloped and now includes restaurants, shops and apartments that should help to revitalize the entire neighborhood.

And if all of that wasn't enough, the Braves have also made a couple of big offseason acquisitions that should make them competitive once again in the NL East. Most notably, they signed slugger Freddie Freeman to an 8-year, $135 million contract extension and acquired outfielder Ender Inciarte from the Diamondbacks in exchange for starting pitcher Shelby Miller.

So make sure to head down to Atlanta this weekend and check out the new Braves' stadium! I'm sure you won't be disappointed!

#  Harper and the Nationals looking to spoil the opening party for the Braves!

In what is sure to be an emotional opening day for the Atlanta Braves, they will have to face off against one of the best teams in baseball in the Washington Nationals. The Nationals are coming into the season looking to win their first World Series and it looks like they may have everything they need to do just that. One of those pieces is their young superstar Bryce Harper.

Harper had a phenomenal season last year, winning the National League MVP award. He hit .318 with 29 home runs and 94 RBIs. He was also impressive in the playoffs, hitting .333 with three home runs and eight RBIs. Harper is coming into this season looking to repeat his MVP performance and help lead the Nationals to a World Series championship.

The Braves are going to have their work cut out for them when they face off against Harper and the Nationals. But, this opening day matchup should be an exciting one, nonetheless.

#  Miami Marlins announce special event for fans on opening day!

The Miami Marlins have announced a special event for their fans on opening day. They are offering a two-for-one ticket deal, and they are also giving away a free t-shirt to the first 2000 fans in attendance.

The Marlins are hoping to attract a large crowd for their opening day game against the Atlanta Braves. The Braves are one of the top teams in the National League, so this should be an exciting matchup.

Fans can buy tickets to the game at the Marlinsâ€™ website or at local ticket outlets. The two-for-one deal is available for all seating categories, except for the Lexus Legends Club and MVP seats.

The free t-shirt will feature the new logo for the Miami Marlins. This is the first season for the team since they moved to their new stadium, Marlins Park.

Opening day is always an exciting time for baseball fans, and the Miami Marlins are hoping to put on a show for their fans at Marlins Park.

#  Philadelphia Phillies announce their opening day lineup!

The Philadelphia Phillies released their opening day lineup today and it features a few surprises.

1st baseman Rhys Hoskins will be leading off followed by shortstop Jean Segura, center fielder Odubel Herrera, right fielder Bryce Harper, third baseman Maikel Franco, left fielder Andrew McCutchen, catcher J.T. Realmuto, and second baseman Cesar Hernandez.

This is Hoskins' first season as the team's leadoff hitter and he seems excited for the challenge. "I'm excited for it," Hoskins said. "I think it'll be a good test for me, see how I can handle some new situations."

Franco will be batting cleanup this season and he's hoping to improve on his 2018 performance in which he hit .270 with 22 homers and 88 RBIs. "I'm just trying to do my job and help the team win games," Franco said. "I don't put any pressure on myself."

The Phillies will open the 2019 season on Thursday, March 28th against the Atlanta Braves at SunTrust Park in Atlanta.

#  Mets look to get off to a hot start in their new home opener!

The Mets look to get off to a strong start as they open their new home opener against the Phillies. The Mets are coming off a disappointing season where they failed to make the playoffs. The Phillies, on the other hand, had a surprise playoff run last year and look to continue their success in 2018.

The Mets will have Jacob deGrom on the mound for their home opener. deGrom is coming off of an impressive 2017 campaign where he finished with an ERA of 3.53 and an 18-9 record. He will be looking to build off of that success this season and help lead the Mets back to the playoffs.

The Phillies will counter with ace Aaron Nola. Nola finished last season with an impressive 14-3 record and 2.37 ERA. He will be looking to continue his solid play and help lead the Phillies back to the playoffs.

It should be a close matchup between two of the NL East's top teams. It should be a fun game to watch and provides a good early test for both teams.
