#  Oklahoma Gambling Ape's Habit Could Cost Him $100,000

An Oklahoma ape who has a gambling habit could lose up to $100,000, according to reports.

The ape, who is known as "Gus," reportedly likes to gamble on games of chance at the Parlor in Tulsa. Gambling experts say that the ape is risking a lot of money and could easily lose it all.

"Gus is making a big mistake," said one expert. "He's risking a lot of money on games that he doesn't have a chance of winning."

According to reports, Gus has been known to bet large amounts of money on games such as roulette and blackjack. He's also been known to place bets on sporting events.

So far, Gus has managed to win some money but he's also lost a lot. In fact, experts say that he may be down as much as $100,000.

Local casino officials are hoping that Gus will eventually stop gambling but they're not holding their breath.

#  Gambling Ape in Arizona Must Repay $5,000

Billy the gambling ape who lives in a zoo in Arizona must repay a $5,000 gambling debt to the zoo, a state appellate court ruled Wednesday.

Billy has been known to place small wagers on sporting events using peanuts as currency. In one such instance, he wagered 10 peanuts on the Cincinnati Reds to defeat the Milwaukee Brewers. The Reds lost and Billy was out of peanuts.

In another instance, Billy bet 20 peanuts on the Arizona Diamondbacks to beat the San Diego Padres. The Diamondbacks won, but Billy only received 10 peanuts back because of the 10 percent commission taken by the bookie.

This gave Billy a net loss of 10 peanuts and, after accounting for progressive compounding over time, $5,000 in negative equity. When zoo officials found out about the debt, they attempted to collect by confiscating Billy's bananas and other food items. But this only left him with a diet of apples and water, so he went on strike. That's when things got really hairy.

After an arbitrator sided with the ape last year, awarding him an unlimited supply of food and 5 million bananas (roughly equal to $5,000 at prevailing black market rates), the state Court of Appeals overturned that decision Wednesday, ruling that gambling is illegal in Arizona and that Billy must repay his debt.

"The legislature could not have intended for animals living in captivity in Arizona to be able to gamble with impunity," wrote Judge Kenton Jones for the unanimous three-judge panel. "To do so would create a system where wild animals could gamble away their allowance or inheritance without consequences."

Billy's attorney said they were "disappointed" with the ruling and planned to appeal to the Arizona Supreme Court.

#  Rhode Island Gambling Ape Loses $500

A gambling ape at the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Rhode Island has lost $500, according to casino officials. The ape, who was identified as "Peanuts", was observed betting on blackjack and other casino games over a period of several days, eventually losing all of his money.

"We were very surprised to see an ape coming in and gambling," said one casino official. "But I guess it just goes to show that even monkeys can get addicted to gambling."

Rhode Island gambling laws are some of the most liberal in the country, and allow for widespread gambling at casinos, racetracks, and online casinos. Gambling addiction is a major problem in Rhode Island, with more than 15% of the population considered to be pathological gamblers.

"It's really unfortunate that so many people in our state are addicted to gambling," said one lawmaker. "But we can't just sit back and do nothing. We need to find ways to help these people before they lose everything."

Despite the proliferation of gambling in Rhode Island, there has been little effort to address the issue of addiction. In fact, lawmakers have been resistant to any measures that would reduce or restrict access to gambling.

"People have a right to gamble if they want to," said one lawmaker. "We should be doing everything we can to make it easier for them, not harder."

#  North Carolina Gambling Ape Wins $1,500

The North Carolina gambling ape has won another big casino payout, taking home $1,500 from a single spin of the roulette wheel. It was the ape's third big win in as many months at the casino, and officials say they have no idea how the primate is doing it.

"The ape seems to have a sixth sense when it comes to gambling," said one casino spokesperson. "He never makes mistakes and always knows when to bet high or low."

While some skeptics claim that the ape is simply lucky, others say he must be using some sort of advanced gambling strategy.

"It's amazing how he can keep track of all the different betting possibilities," said one mathematician. "He must have an incredible memory."

Regardless of how he's doing it, the ape's winning streak is sure to excite his fans back in North Carolina.

#  Nevada Gambling Ape Could Earn Over $1 Million

* The Nevada gambling ape earning an estimated $1.17 million in 2018.

The recently released figures by the American Gaming Association (AGA) show that casino revenue generated in the state last year totaled a whopping $11.17 billion. While humans were responsible for most of this money, one furry creature can lay claim to a pretty hefty chunk of it – the Nevada gambling ape.

This simian has been known to take to the slots and tables in Las Vegas and other Sin City casinos on a regular basis, and is thought to have raked in over $1 million in winnings over the past 12 months alone. With such a fruitful history, it’s no wonder this monkey is considered one of the luckiest creatures on the planet!

Interestingly, it’s not just humans who are benefiting from Sin City’s gambling boom. The AGA report also shows that 2017 was a bumper year for gaming industry jobs, with over 15,000 new positions created. This is good news for both casino workers and those looking for well-paid employment opportunities. And with new casinos being planned or under construction in several states around the country, this figure looks set to grow even further in 2019 and beyond.

So if you ever find yourself in Las Vegas or one of its many sister cities, be sure to keep an eye out for our hairy friend – he could be the key to your financial success!
