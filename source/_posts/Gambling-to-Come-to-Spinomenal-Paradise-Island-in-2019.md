#  Paradise Island to Get its First Gambling Resort in 2019

The Bahamas is one of the most visited places in the world. Tourists come to enjoy its clear blue waters, stunning beaches, and lush vegetation. Now, there’s another reason to visit the island paradise – gambling.

Paradise Island, which is located just off the coast of Nassau, will soon have its first casino resort. The $350 million development will be called The Baha Mar and it is scheduled to open in 2019.

The Baha Mar will have a 120,000-square-foot casino with over 1,000 slot machines and 50 table games. It will also have a variety of restaurants, a luxury spa, and a championship golf course.

The casino resort is being developed by Chinese company Chow Tai Fook Enterprises Ltd and it is expected to create 2,500 jobs. Bahamian Prime Minister Perry Christie said that the development “will provide an important stimulus for our economy and bring much-needed jobs for Bahamians”.

Casinos are currently not allowed in The Bahamas, but this is about to change. A bill that would legalize gambling in the country was passed by the House of Assembly in June 2017 and it is now awaiting approval from the Senate.

If it is approved, The Baha Mar will be one of the largest casinos in the Caribbean region.
