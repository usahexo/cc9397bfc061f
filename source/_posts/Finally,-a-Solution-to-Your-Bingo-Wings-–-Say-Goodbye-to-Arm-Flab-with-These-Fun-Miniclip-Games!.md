Hold this position for 30 seconds, then switch legs and repeat.

The next workout is the wall sit. Start by standing with your back against a wall, then slowly slide down until your thighs are parallel with the ground. Hold this position for 30 seconds, then release and stand up.

The third workout is the chair dip. Sit in a chair with both palms flat on the edge of the chair, then slowly lift yourself off the chair so that you're supporting yourself with just your hands. Bend your knees until they form 90-degree angles, then press down into the chair to raise yourself back up to starting position. Repeat 10 times.

The fourth workout is the plank. Get into a push-up position but instead of resting on your palms, place them directly under your shoulders so that your body forms a straight line from head to heels. Brace your abs and hold for 30 seconds. If this is too difficult, start by doing 3 or 4 reps at a time and work up to 30 seconds over time.

The fifth and final workout is the bridge pose. Lie flat on your back with feet flat on the ground and shoulder-width apart, legs bent to 90 degrees.
