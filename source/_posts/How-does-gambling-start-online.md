#  How does gambling start online?

Online gambling has come a long way since the early days of the internet. It once used to be a small, niche industry, but it is now one of the most popular forms of online entertainment. So, how did online gambling become so big?

The first online casinos started appearing in 1994, and they were very basic. There was no real graphics or animation, and the games were simple. However, people soon realised that gambling online was a lot of fun, and it started to grow in popularity.

The early 2000s saw a huge increase in the popularity of online gambling, and this was largely due to the development of new technologies. The internet became faster and more reliable, which made it easier for people to gamble online. In addition, new software platforms were developed which allowed casinos to offer better games and graphics.

As technology progressed, so too did online gambling. More and more people started to gamble online, and new casino games were developed. In particular, slot machines became extremely popular on casino websites. This was largely due to the fact that they could be played for free and players could win real money prizes.

Today, online gambling is one of the most popular forms of entertainment on the internet. There are thousands of different casino games available to play, and millions of people around the world enjoy gambling online each year.
